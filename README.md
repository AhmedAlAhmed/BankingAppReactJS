# Banking App - Test

In this simple repo I have just made a very simple code & user interface
to allow employees to add customers/accounts

because we need to send a request from our front-end side to `Stripe` server
then send the `token` in the response to our server.

as already mentioned in the bank-end repository to avoid `MIMT` attacks

This repo/code is not required within the test specifications, but implemented to make the flow being easier to the
tester.

in order to run this repo, just clone it and run

```
npm install

npm start
```
